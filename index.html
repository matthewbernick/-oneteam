							<h2>Oppurtunity requires efforts</h2>

							<p><strong>#ONETEAM was started with the idea of providing balls, sporting equipment, and accessories to those that may not be able to provide it for themselves. </strong> "There's a real butterfly effect with #ONETEAM that excites me for the future. It's not much, but a simple basketball, football, soccerball, etc. could provide an outlet for some. With that being the potential, I believe there needs to be much more activity and time devoted to a project looking to assist in these deficits." - CEO/Founder Matthew Bernick (left) </p>

							<p><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/airmontana/">@Airmontana</a></strong> is the current location for #ONETEAM. An instagram page promoted internationally, generated numberous responses in regards to a shortage in sporting supplies. Being able to supply within the United States came with some hurdles, but it was the international shipping that has created an issue for supplying more people who could really use the goods. </p>

							<p>The feedback has been extremely positive and the small impact has been felt, but certainly could be escalated. As their are still many unfulfilled orders due to current limitations.</p>
